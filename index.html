          <h3 class="title">Sriracha shrimp with asparagus</h3>

          <img class="main-pic" alt="" src="http://damndelicious.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_5191edit.jpg" />

          <p>Asparagus is one of my favourite vegetables. In my corner of the
          world fresh, locally farmed asparagus is available May-June. This year
          I conducted an experiment to eat asparagus 4-5 times a week for at
          least 3 weeks. It would force me to play with different preparations
          to avoid getting tired of it. A couple of delicious meals came out of
          this.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Shrimp <abbr title="This means large shrimp. If bought frozen it'll often say this on the package.">(20-30 per pound)</abbr></li>
                <li>Asparagus</li>
                <li>Lemon juice</li>

              <p>
                <strong>Mise en place:</strong> peel shrimp, crush garlic, chop
                shallots, cut ends off asparagus, boil salted water and prepare
                ice bath.
              </p>

              <p>
                Put asparagus in boiling water for 3m and place them in an ice
                bath. This helps them retain their texture and green colour. We
                cook them lightly beforehand because cooking them through on the
                pan would over cook the shrimp.
              </p>

              <p>
                Bring your favourite skillet or cast iron to high heat with
                olive oil. Add shrimp, about a minute on each side. Throw in
                shallots, salt and sriracha and toss. Then take the asparagus
                from the ice bath along with the garlic and capers. Finally, add
                lemon juice to taste. Serve hot with big salt flakes.
