Truffle Grater is where people who trust each other's recommendations share
their favorite restaurants around the world. It's a scaleable form of the most
proven recommendation system: asking your friends, who are influenced by their
friends. As well as the waiters and chefs at the restaurants you enjoy the most.

An endorsement means: You'd go back at chance. If your friend from out of town
had a single night in the city, this is where you'd take them. Worth trekking
across the city for. Worth travelling for along with your other endorsements.
Good enough you don't need to tell people more than the name and address. People
are accountable for their endorsements.
