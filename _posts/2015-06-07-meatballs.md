steps: "
**Mise en place**: chop onion, crush garlic, pre-heat oven to 375F/190C.


Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl with your hands. Then form meat balls in
whatever size you like on a baking tray. It helps to have a bowl with water to
wet your hands. Bake in the oven for ~20-25m.

ingredients:
- name: "Ground meat: Turkey / Beef / Pork + Beef"

  optional: true

These are a staple in my diet. I always have a kilo or two in my freezer.
Typically I make 2-4kg of those on Sundays. They are extremely easy to make, I
often add other ingredients to empty my fridge and experiment with spices. They
go with pretty much anything. Turkey meat especially can be incredibly boring,
but with spices it lightens up.
