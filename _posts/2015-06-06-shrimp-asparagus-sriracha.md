steps: "
**Mise en place:** peel shrimp, crush garlic, chop shallots, cut ends off
asparagus, boil salted water and prepare ice bath.


Put asparagus in boiling water for 3m and place them in an ice bath. This helps
them retain their texture and green colour. We cook them lightly beforehand
because cooking them through on the pan would over cook the shrimp.


Bring your favourite skillet or cast iron to high heat with olive oil. Add
shrimp, about a minute on each side. Throw in shallots, salt and sriracha and
toss. Then take the asparagus from the ice bath along with the garlic and
capers. Finally, add lemon juice to taste. Serve hot with big salt flakes."
ingredients:
- name: Shrimp (20-30 per pound)
  note: This means large shrimp. If bought frozen it'll often say this on the package.
- name: Asparagus
- name: Lemon juice
- name: Olive oil
- name: Salt
  note: I use Maldon salt sea flakes for topping and sea salt during cooking
- name: Shallots / onion
  note: I prefer shallots for lighter tasting foods like shrimp, but if you only have onions handy use them!
- name: Sriracha / hot sauce / chilli flakes
  note: You can also leave this out. Experiment with anything hot.
- name: (Capers)

Asparagus is one of my favourite vegetables. In my corner of the
world fresh, locally farmed asparagus is available May-June. This year
I conducted an experiment to eat asparagus 4-5 times a week for at
least 3 weeks. It would force me to play with different preparations
to avoid getting tired of it. A couple of delicious meals came out of
this.
