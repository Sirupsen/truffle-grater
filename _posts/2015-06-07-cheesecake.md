title: Protein cheesecake
steps: "
**Mise en place**: Let yogurt, cream cheese, egg whites sit until they're at
around room temperature. Otherwise especially the cream cheese won't mix well.
Grate chocolate. Mash bananas. Oil spring form. Pre-heat oven to 350F.


Put all the ingredient in a bowl. You may have to mix it with your hands before
using a whisk. Electronic whisking works too.


Add to form and bake in oven for about 40-50m depending on size of form.
